        "description": "At EVOP, I joined as an Intern, where I was able to work on monolithic software in Java and Angular. In the beginning, the entire system was generated on a local server, however, due to hacker attacks we were forced to migrate to the cloud. And the AWS Cloud was chosen. As a challenge to be implemented, I was responsible for creating a microservice to act on the monolithic. The purpose of this microservice was to communicate with ASAAS, which was responsible for generating payment invoices for our users' customers. For the software to capture the status of the bills, I created a messaging system with Kafka and SQS, to update when there was a change in the bill's status (cancelled, paid, expired, among others...). Once hired, I was responsible for creating new features in the WEB part of the software, creating dashboards and report generators (PDF and EXCEL). My codes have always been well oriented to follow the clean code standard: SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, DRY.",
